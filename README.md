## Installation
<!-- Run 'npm i' within the console, located at the root level of the directory. This will pull in the necessary node modules/packages.

Once necessary dependencies are installed, "npm run start" (or 'nodemon server.js" if you have nodemon installed) in the console. 

This will open a port at localhost:3001, accessible when 'localhost:3001' searched in browser, or when opened via Insomnia as demonstrated in the video link provided.

The attached video walkthrough will demonstrate the application's functionality by running through CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) as they pertain to a NoSQL type social network. -->
